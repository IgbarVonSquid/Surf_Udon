## Setup
1. Download the latest SDK3 – Worlds Unitypackage from VRChat (SDK2 will not work!)
2. Import the SDK into your Unity project.
3. Find the VRCWorld prefab under VRChat Examples > Prefabs and drag it into your scene.
4. Bring up the VRChat SDK Control Panel, login, then click the prompts to build the Layers and Collision Matrix.
5. Find the Surf_Systems prefab in the Surf_Udon folder and drag it into your scene.
6. At this point you should Build & Test the scene to make sure everything works. Simply jump from the starting platform to the finish platform while watching your velocity, time, etc to make sure all the systems work as expected.
7. You can now start building out a basic course. You’ll find ramps and boosters in their respective folders under the Surf_Udon > prefabs folder. If you ever get lost or confused you can refer to the Tutorial Scene in the Surf_Udon folder to see how things are setup there.
